# **Scrumban Server**

## üìñ ***Description***

This is a Ruby server for use with the associated [React client](https://github.com/NicMortelliti/scrumban-client).

The server accepts the following HTTP requests:
| **Path** | **Request Type** | **Action** |
|------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| / | GET | Retrieve all tasks with associated project and assigned user. |
| /users | GET | Retrieve all users. |
| /projects | GET | Retrieve all projects. |
| /tasks | GET | Retrieve all tasks. |
| /tasks | POST | Add new task to database. Then, receive the new task, user and project details. |
| /tasks/:id | PATCH | Update task matching id. Then, receive updated task, user and project details. |
| /tasks/:id | DELETE | Delete task matching id. |

### *Entity-Relationship*

The Entity-Relationship Diagram below displays the relationships between the three tables contained within the database. The tasks table is the join table, joining programs and users. The tasks table contains two foreign ID's. One points to the ID of the associated project (***project_id***) and the other points to ID of the associated (assigned) user (***user_id***). The diagram also shows that a task can only have *one* program and *one* user. However, both programs and users may have *many* tasks.

## üñ•Ô∏è ***Install***

### *Clone the repository*

```shell
git clone git@github.com:NicMortelliti/scrumban-server.git server
cd server
```

### *Check your Ruby version*

```shell
ruby -v
```

The output should start with something like `ruby 2.7`.

If not, install the right ruby version using [rvm](https://rvm.io/). If using a linux-based system, I highly recommend following the [installation guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/RVM) from the arch wiki instead:

```shell
rvm install 2.6
```

### *Install dependencies*

Using [Bundler](https://bundler.io/):

```shell
bundle install
```

### *Initialize the database*

```shell
rake db:migrate db:seed
```

---

## üëü ***Run***

### *Start the server*

```shell
rake server
```

The server should now be running on ```localhost:9292```.
